# snap-destroyer
Cannonical makes you use snaps by force. Even `apt` packages are fake packages now. This script removes all the snaps and
makes you unable to install them. So using `sudo apt install chromium` will not install snap again.


## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/cemkagank/snap-destroyer
cd snap-destroyer
sudo ./sayanora.sh
```
